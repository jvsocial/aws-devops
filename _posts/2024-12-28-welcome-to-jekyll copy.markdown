**Text-Based Diagram (Adaptable to Visual Form):**

```
+-----------------+     Traffic Switch    +-----------------+
|   Blue (Live)   |--------------------->|  Green (New)   |
+--------+--------+                     +--------+--------+
         |                                     ^
         |                                     |
         |                                     | Deployment
         v                                     |
+-----------------+                     |
|  Green (Idle)   |<---------------------|
+-----------------+     Next Deploy     |
                                          |
                                          +-----------------+
                                          |   Blue (Idle)   |
                                          +-----------------+
```

**Explanation of the Text Diagram:**

*   **Boxes:** Represent the environments (Blue and Green).
*   **"Blue (Live)"**: The currently active environment serving user traffic.
*   **"Green (New)"**: The environment where the new version is deployed.
*   **"Green (Idle)"/ "Blue (Idle)"**: The environment that is not currently serving traffic and is ready for the next deployment.
*   **"Traffic Switch" Arrow:** Shows the redirection of traffic from Blue to Green.
*   **"Deployment" Arrow:** Shows the deployment of the new version to the Green environment.
*   **"Next Deploy" Arrow:** Shows how the old Blue environment becomes the new Green for the subsequent deployment.

**How to Convert this to a Visual Diagram:**

1.  **Boxes:** Draw two rectangles or rounded rectangles. Label them "Blue" and "Green."
2.  **Arrows:** Use arrows to connect the boxes as shown in the text diagram.
3.  **Labels:** Add labels like "Live," "New," and "Idle" to the boxes to clarify their status.
4.  **Color:** Use blue and green colors for the respective boxes to reinforce the concept.

**Example of a simple visual representation (using characters):**

```
+-------+     Traffic Switch     +-------+
| Blue  |---------------------->| Green |
| Live  |                      | New   |
+-------+                      +-------+
      ^                            |
      | Deployment                 |
      +----------------------------+
```

This is a very basic representation, but it gets the core idea across.

By using the text-based diagram as a starting point and adding some visual elements, you can create a clear and effective diagram for your study notes or handout.
